## Overview

Surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators host massless Dirac
fermions protected by time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we study the effects
of a time-reversal-invariant fractal potential on these surface Dirac states.
Using large-scale numerical calculations, we demonstrate the emergence of
self-similar quantum states with noninteger (fractal) dimensionality and analyze
their spectral and spatial properties.

This repository provides the numerical implementations used to construct the
model Hamiltonians, perform exact diagonalization, and analyze fractal quantum
states discussed in the paper.
